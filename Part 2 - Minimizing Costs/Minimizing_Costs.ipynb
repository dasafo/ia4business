    "# Reducing costs of data center cooling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will configure our own server environment and build an AI that will control the cooling/heating of the server to keep it in an optimal temperature range and at the same time we need to save the maximum energy, thus minimizing costs. Our goal will be to achieve at least 40% energy savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 - Boundary Conditions and program operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average atmospheric temperature for a month.\n",
    "* The optimal range of server temperature: **[15ºC, 25ºC]**.\n",
    "* The minimum server temperature: **-25ºC** (it doesn't operate below).\n",
    "* The maximum server temperature:  **80ºC** (it doesn't work above).\n",
    "* The minimum number of users on the server: **8**.\n",
    "* The maximum number of users on the server: **120**.\n",
    "* The maximum number of users on the server that it can up or down per minute: **6**.\n",
    "* The minimum data transmission rate on the server: **20**.\n",
    "* The maximum data transmission speed on the server: **400**.\n",
    "* The maximum data transmission speed that can go up or down per minute: **10**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Server temperature at any time.\n",
    "* Number of users on the server at any time.\n",
    "* Data transmission speed at any minute\n",
    "* AI's energy expended on the server (to cool or heat it) at any time.\n",
    "* The energy expended by the server's integrated cooling system that automatically brings the server temperature to the optimal range whenever the server temperature is out of this optimal range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We are going to make two assumptions to facilitate the work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the server temperature can be approximated by Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Server \\hspace{2mm} temp. = a_0 + b_1 \\cdot atmosph. temp. + b_2 \\cdot Num.users + b_3 \\cdot data\\hspace{2mm} trans.rate$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_0 \\in \\mathbb R$, $b_1,b_2,b_3 > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the atmospheric temperature rieses, the server temperature rises too. The more users are active on the server, the more the server will spend to handle them, and therefore the server temperature will be higher. And finally, the more data is transmitted within the server, the more the server will spend to process it, and therefore the higher the server temperature will be. And for simplicity, we just assume these correlations are linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to give values to parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Server \\hspace{2mm} temp. = 0 + 1 \\cdot atmosph. temp. + 1.3 \\cdot Num.users + 1.3 \\cdot data\\hspace{2mm} trans.rate$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, the energy expended by our system (IA or IRS) that changes the server temperature from $T_t$ to $T_{t+1}$ in a unit of time (1 minute in our problem), it can be approximated again by linear function regression of the absolute change in server temperature: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_t=\\alpha |\\varDelta T_t| + \\beta = \\alpha |T_{t+1} - T_t| + \\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $E_t$ is the energy expended by the system between $t$ and $t+1$.\n",
    "- $\\varDelta T_t$ is the change of temperature of the system between $t$ and $t+1$.\n",
    "- $T_t$ and $T_{t+1}$ are the server temperature in $t$ and $t+1$.\n",
    "- $\\alpha >0$ and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb R$. Althought we put them like $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=0$(for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finnaly we have:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "### How the simulation works:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to simulate a real server and for that the number of users and data transmission speed will fluctuate randomly. AI has to understand how much cooling and heating power it must transfer to server. In this way the program must be able to spend the least energy optimizing its heat transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two possible systems can regulate the server temperature: the AI or the server's integrated cooling system. The integrated server cooling system is a non-intelligent system. This system will automatically return the server temperature to its optimal temperature. \n",
    "The integrated system(no-IA) works only when IA system not work. If IA is enabled, no-IA is disabled and then the IA updates the server temperature. The IA system is non-deterministic because it predicts what temperatureto set based on the previous parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IA must spend less energy than the intern cooling system. Therefore we can see in the second assumption the energy is  proportional to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy saved by IA every time (1 minute) is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "        \\textrm{IA Energy saved between $t$ y $t+1$}\n",
    "        & = |\\Delta T_t^{\\textrm{Intern System Server (no-IA)}}| - |\\Delta T_t^{\\textrm{IA}}| \\\\\n",
    "        & = |\\Delta T_t^{\\textrm{no IA}}| - |\\Delta T_t^{\\textrm{IA}}|\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to save the maximum energy every minute, thus save the maximum total energy for 1 whole simulation year, and finally save the maximum costs on the cooling/heating electricity bill. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's to define the states, actions and rewards. \n",
